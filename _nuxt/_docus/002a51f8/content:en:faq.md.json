Ejenda is, and always will be free.\n\n## Can I use this offline?\n\nSomewhat. Currently, it will load but error out. This is a WIP.\n\n## Can you see what I have to do?\n\nYour items are stored on our servers. We do not look at them.\n\n## Can I send my students a link to import assignments?\n\nYes. Go to our [teachers page](https://ejenda.org/teachers) to get started.\n\n## Is Ejenda safe?\n\nYes.

You can go to [this link](https://ejenda.org/google/auth/) and select a new account.\n\n## I found a bug, what do I do?\n\nIf you found a bug, you can either make an issue on our github at https://github.com/Ejenda/Ejenda, contact our support at\nsupport@ejenda.org.\n\n## How can I help?\n\nYou can show Ejenda to other students, or show your teachers it.
